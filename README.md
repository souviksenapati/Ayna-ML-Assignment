## üìà Training Results

The model was trained for 200 epochs, achieving excellent performance and high-quality visual output. The training process involved key decisions, such as changing the loss function, which were critical to the final result.

### Final Performance Statistics
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Best Validation Loss (L1)** | **0.0071** | Achieved at Epoch 200 |
| **Final Validation MAE** | 0.007123 | Low pixel-wise error |
| **Final Validation PSNR** | 32.32 dB | High image quality |
| **Total Training Epochs**| 200 | Full training run |

### Final Training Configuration
```yaml
Model: ConditionalUNet
Optimizer: Adam
Learning Rate: 5e-4
Weight Decay: 1e-5
Batch Size: 8
Loss Function: L1Loss
Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
Epochs: 200
```

### Loss Function Rationale

The model was initially trained using Mean Squared Error (`MSELoss`), which is a common choice for image regression tasks. However, this resulted in visually blurry outputs with hazy edges.

To achieve sharper, more defined results, the loss function was changed to **`L1Loss`** (Mean Absolute Error). This change was critical for improving the perceptual quality of the generated images, as `L1Loss` is less prone to averaging out details and encourages the model to produce cleaner boundaries.

---

### Per-Color Performance Analysis

The final model's performance was evaluated on a per-color basis using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the validation set. The results show consistently low error across all colors, indicating that the model learned to generate each color accurately.

| Color | Validation MSE |
|:---|:---|
| üîµ **Blue** | 0.000971 |
| üåê **Cyan** | 0.000332 |
| üü¢ **Green** | 0.000512 |
| üü° **Yellow** | 0.000865 |

The low MSE values confirm that the color conditioning mechanism was effective and the model did not exhibit a significant bias or weakness for any particular color in the palette.
```

### Quantitative Performance

The model was evaluated on the validation set at the end of training. The final results demonstrate a high level of accuracy and image quality.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Best Validation Loss (L1)** | **0.0071** |
| **Achieved at Epoch** | 200 |
| **Final Validation MAE** | 0.007123 |
| **Final Validation PSNR** | 32.32 dB |

**Analysis:**
* A **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** of `0.0071` indicates that, on average, the predicted pixel values are extremely close to the ground truth.
* A **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** of `32.32 dB` is considered a very strong result for image generation tasks, confirming that the output images are high-quality and have low noise.

---

### Learning Curve Analysis

The training progressed smoothly over the 200 epochs.
* **Initial Phase (Epochs 1-50):** The model exhibited a rapid decrease in both training and validation loss as it learned the primary task of filling shapes.
* **Convergence Phase (Epochs 50-150):** The loss continued to decrease steadily, and the model refined its ability to produce sharp edges and accurate colors.
* **Fine-tuning Phase (Epochs 150-200):** The loss curve flattened, indicating that the model had converged to an optimal state. The training and validation loss curves tracked each other closely throughout the process, showing no signs of significant overfitting.

### Development Journey & Key Decisions

Instead of formal ablation studies, the model was improved through a series of methodical, iterative experiments to solve specific problems.

#### 1. Loss Function Comparison: `MSELoss` vs. `L1Loss`

The initial choice of loss function had a significant impact on the output quality.

| Loss Function | Result | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MSE Loss** | Produced blurry outputs with hazy edges and color bleeding. | **Rejected** |
| **L1 Loss** | Produced sharp, well-defined edges and clean backgrounds. | ‚úÖ **Final Choice** |

This experiment confirmed that `L1Loss` is better suited for this image-to-image task where perceptual sharpness is important.

#### 2. Color Conditioning Fix

A critical bug was discovered where the model would consistently output the wrong color (e.g., "magenta" for "yellow").

| Pipeline Version | Result | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Independent Datasets** | Severe color swapping due to inconsistent `color_to_idx` maps. | **Rejected** |
| **Unified Global Map** | All colors were mapped correctly by creating a single, shared `color_to_idx` map for both training and validation. | ‚úÖ **Final Choice** |

This highlighted the critical importance of a consistent and robust data pipeline.
